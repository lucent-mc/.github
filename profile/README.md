## About Us

Lucent is the team behind a small number of Minecraft mod packs built on fabric that focus on immersion, ambiance, and investment. The aim is to enhance visuals and sounds, as well as extend the gameplay loop, by both slowing it down, as well as extend it.
Our strategy is to work from the ground up. We want to add flavour to the game without destroying performance, This is why we've split the project up into stages, all of which are playable mod packs of their own.

### Our Projects

- [Lucent Optimizations]() - Improve performance without altering the game.
- [Lucent Visuals]() - Client-side tweaks, sounds and visuals. Vanilla-compatible.
